# 🌿 TLC-Image Quantitative Analysis Algorithm 🧪

Welcome to the **TLC-Image Quantitative Analysis Algorithm** repository! This project implements the algorithmic core for automating **thin-layer chromatography (TLC) quantitative analysis**. It processes TLC images to determine the **concentration ratios** of components in a mixture using advanced **image processing**, **peak detection**, and **mathematical modeling** techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **🖌️ Image Preprocessing:**  
  Efficient background removal, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction to prepare images for analysis.
- **📊 Peak Detection & Analysis:**  
  Robust detection and quantification of substance peaks from TLC images.
- **📏 Calibration & Mixture Calculation:**  
  Mathematical models for precise concentration determination.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python:** Leveraging libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, and SciPy.
- **📊 Matplotlib:** For data visualization and result presentation.
